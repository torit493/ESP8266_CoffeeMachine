# CoffeeMachine

This code is for controlling a coffe machine so I get coffee in the morning automatically. It uses a stepper for opening the filter, two servos for turning on the power and filling ground coffee beans and an ESP8266 for controlling the whole thing and connect ti the internet!
Several libraries needs to be installed in the Arduino IDE to make it work: ESP8266WiFi, AccelStepper and some more ESP8266 specific libraries. It also collects the correct time from WiFi connection.

The project is made as a first GitHub project so will not be very pretty probably, but i will learn as i go along :)
